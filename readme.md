# WALL OF WONDER

Hey you!!

Welcome to the Wall of Wonder readme. A little context on the project:

1. This is a project I decide to do in order to help artists especially local ones to get market for their art, because what is the world without art, right?
2. I'm working on it as a side project so I'm developing features slowly by slowly.
3. I'm trying to implement a certain interface first using HTML and CSS but I'll probably develop it further using React.js after a while.
4. Feel free to reach out to me for any questions, comments, suggestions or collaboration I'm open to all that good stuff.

See you for now, I got to go get some coffee and start coding.
More updates coming soon.
